 The plan for this project is to extend my very first personal project (the Tic-Tac-Toe game) by: adding bots powered by neural nets, a frontend, and more board games.

On the neural net side of things I want to get an understanding for implementing different training methods such as imitation learning and reinforcement learning.

On the web devlopment side I will use this project to learn a modern web framework, React, understand the basics of hosting, and build a simple backend to link the trained neural nets with the user interface.
